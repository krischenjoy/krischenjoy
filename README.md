Hi, I'm Christien! 

I've been a credit risk analyst a few years and I've recently took interest in ✨reinforcement learning✨.

I'm also a student of Master's in Business Analytics, wherein I would be creating some machine learning projects in the future.

Outside graduate school, I've been crunching through several e-courses for visualization tools and data science.

With all the learning opportunities I have, I decided to find some place to store my projects and eventually organize my portfolio.

I found GitHub perfect for this purpose, so, I decided to learn Git. Consider me a total beginner, but I hope to connect with data masters here.
